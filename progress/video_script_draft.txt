The modern world separates us from the natural world. Together we can change that. 

Introducing technology that inspires people to work together, to grow together for all of us. 

All around us, in our cities, our suburbs, our parks and country there are wonders of nature and marvels of human progress. However, human progress is a also threat to nature; individuals can make a difference. Communities can change the world. 

What you are about to see is how the power of individual actions woven into a powerful community can drive positive progress and growth. 

Wattle Watch started with a problem. ..something something...

    “... harness the power of the everyday citizen...” 

    Managing and protecting our biodiversity from invasive species 

    Tracking and monitoring the health of our local koalas and platypi 

    All ideas welcome, and remember to focus on our Moreton Bay region! 

    “We are looking for a snappy pitch, an innovative approach and a working prototype of the solution” 

 

Wattle Watch is an interactive web app that encourages people to go outside, explore the wilderness, document their discoveries and interact with other locals about their favourite landmarks. A real-time augmented reality user interface provides users with information about the flora and fauna they encounter. It recognises and augments the image with animals you would expect to see. The app provides features to leave a digital note on a significant tree for other users to find.

[] Including 192 significant trees 

[] Between 2009 and 2021 surveys of shorebird nesting sites have increased our understanding of their habitat 

[] From 20 18 to 20 21 the number of unique koala sightings has increased from 79 to 126

[] However, to protect our future we need to do better 

[] It’s vital that we build community and awareness of our surroundings 

[] As shown by the data on shorebird roosts and koala sightings
