# Wattle Watch

A project to use the power of the everyday citizen to protect and grow our region
to help create a flourishing planet for years to come.

This project primarily uses data published by the
[City of Morton Bay](https://datahub.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/)
in their DataHub. In particular it uses data from the govhack category at
[Morton Bay DataHub](https://datahub.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/search?categories=%252Fcategories%252Fgovhack)

The challenge:

_How might AI enhance environmental governance in the Pine Rivers catchment through improved data
management, integration, and reporting? How might we integrate diverse datasets and identify trends
to improve decision-making and foster collaboration to support community and environmental
wellbeing?_
