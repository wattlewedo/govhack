# Wattle Watch

A project to use the power of the everyday citizen to protect and grow our region
to help create a flourishing planet for years to come.

This project primarily uses data published by the
[City of Morton Bay](https://datahub.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/)
in their DataHub. In particular it uses data from the govhack category at
[Morton Bay DataHub](https://datahub.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/search?categories=%252Fcategories%252Fgovhack)

## The [GovHack 2024](https://govhack.org/) challenges:

[Moreton Bay Greening as We Grow (QLD)](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/moreton_bay_greening_as_we_grow_qld_378)

_How might we harness the power of the everyday citizen to help protect our diverse flora and fauna
as we grow our region, creating a diverse and flourishing planet for generations to come?_

[Boosting Tourism in the Northern Territory](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/boosting_tourism_in_the_northern_territory)

_How can data be leveraged to create innovative solutions that boost tourism in the Northern
Territory, attract more visitors, and/or enhance their cultural experience?_

[Civic participation for a more resilient, cohesive democracy](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/civic_participation_for_a_more_resilient_cohesive_democracy)

_How can we help more people to understand their democracy, have an opportunity to participate in
civic life, contribute to their community, and/or feel a sense of belonging and responsibility?_
